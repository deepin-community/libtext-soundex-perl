Comment: With the 3.05 upstream release by somebody else than Mark
 Mielke in 2015 seems to have changed the declared license of the
 distribution in its metadata to "the same terms as Perl 5",
 i.e. "Artistic or GPL-1+. But the license comment on top of Soundex.*
 stayed the same. So we currently assume that just the license of the
 accompanying distribution files has changed.
